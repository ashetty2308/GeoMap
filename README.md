# GeoMap

GeoMap is a web-app I created that allows users to explore different parts of the world. 

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

A special shout out to the several tutorials and online notes/guides/help-threads I referenced for this project. The following video was extremely helpful and informative when I created my UI layouts.
